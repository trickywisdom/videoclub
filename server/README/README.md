Movie search: Users can search for movies using keywords for the title.
Random movie quote: The application displays a random quote from a movie on the first page.

Movie save: The save button saves the selected movie to the user's account in the database.
Saved movies: The application has a link that navigates users to their saved movies page, where they can view the movies they have saved. Each saved movie is displayed with an image, title, and a delete button.
